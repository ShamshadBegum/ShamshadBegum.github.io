# GSB.DEV — Security & Automation Portfolio

Cyber Security Compliance | IAM | Process Automation  
4+ Years Experience | Enterprise Clients | Production-Grade Automation

I design automation systems that eliminate manual compliance work and make audits traceable, repeatable, and scalable.

From 10-day manual validation workflows to 25-minute single-click solutions — production ready and management approved.

## 🏗️ Featured Automation Projects

### 1. SAT Results Validation & Consolidator
- Built using Excel VBA + Power Query (M Language)
- ETL-style processing pipeline
- Execution logging framework
- 0 manual errors
- Reduced 10-day process to 25 minutes

Architecture:
Input Folder → ETL Processing → Validation → Logging → Consolidated Output

### 2. Parallel Unzip Engine (PowerShell)
- Runspace parallel processing
- Resume & auto-retry logic
- GUI progress window
- JSON configuration driven
- Standalone EXE deployment

Key Concept:
Controlled parallelism with structured logging and safe restart capability.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

My focus is not just automation — but audit-safe automation.

Every solution includes:
- Structured execution logging
- Error traceability
- Safe retry logic
- Configurable runtime behavior
- Controlled user interaction

Automation should reduce effort without reducing control.
